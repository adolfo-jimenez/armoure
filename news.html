                <h2>The Origins of the Burrito</h2>
                <h5>September 25th, 2021</h5>
                <p>Where did the famous Mexican food dubbed the "burrito" originate from? To be honest, I don't know and this is something I think about a lot so much that I lose sleep. We will find out one day, mark my words.</p>

                <h5>April 22nd, 2021</h5>
                <p>So I decided to start on an interesting experiment and that is to swap two basic ingredients and those ingredients are the potato and tomato. Introducing Tomato Fries with fine-blended Potatoes as a side condiment dip.</p>

                <h5>December 12th, 2020</h5>
                <p>I was recently approached by NBC Universal and asked if I wanted to partake in the production of the soundtrack for the upcoming NBC made-for-tv movie titled, <i>"The Chronicles of LeTight"</i>, I said, "Heck yeah! I'll do it."</p>

                <h2>Time is Money (Misery)</h2>
                <h5>August 2nd, 2020</h5>
                <p>Being under lockdown for almost 5 months now with no end in sight. I just finished binge watching <i>"The Cosby Show"</i> on Netflix and also being limited at home to only being able to do pilates is pathetic. There's is so much time but absolutely nothing to do. I'm just going to watch the paint dry until this pandemic is over. It's not like I can take advantage of the situation, right?</p>

                <h2>This whole Coronavirus thing isn't going to last too long</h2>
                <h5>March 18th, 2020</h5>
                <p>Everyone is freaking out about the Coronavirus outbreak in Europe. Relax people, this is just like the common flu. Absolutely nothing bad is going to happen. 2020 is going to be a good year. I have a good feeling about it. I'm going to do a lot of traveling to places I've never been to like Wuhan, China and I just bought myself a nice condo apartment in Miami that I still have to move all my stuff into. I'm sure all this virus mumbo jumbo will blow over in a few weeks.</p>
